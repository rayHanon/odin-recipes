        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>

        <li>2 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

        <li>1 yellow onion, sliced</li>

        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon capers</li>

        <li>1 anchovy filet</li>

        <li>1 cup white wine</li>

        <li>2 cups crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce</li>

        <li>1/2 cup water</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon paste</li>

        <li>3 red or orange bell peppers, seeded and cut into 3/8-inch strips</li>

        <li>3 slices prosciutto, cut into strips</li>

        <li>chopped Italian parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a sharp knife to make 2 cuts through the skin in the center of the thigh, down to the bone, about one inch apart from each other. Once cut, transfer thighs into a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with 2 teaspoons olive oil, and season with salt, black pepper, cayenne, and dried herbs. Use tongs to toss until very thoroughly coated. Wrap and refrigerate chicken for at least 2 hours, or up to 12 hours</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat remaining olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet on medium-high heat. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook until a deep golden brown crust has formed, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn chicken over and cook for 3 minutes more. Turn off heat, remove chicken to a plate, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Turn heat back on to medium, and add onions. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes or until the onions just begin to soften. Make a space in the center of the pan, and add garlic, capers, and anchovy. Cook for about 1 minute, while stirring and smashing with the edge of a wooden spoon or spatula.</li>
        <li>Pour in wine, and raise the heat to high. Cook, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes until the wine reduces by about half. Add tomatoes, water, and chicken bouillon paste; stir to combine. Return mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid reduces slightly, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sliced peppers, and mix in evenly. Scatter about 3/4 of prosciutto slices evenly over the top. Place chicken thighs back on top, spaced evenly, skin side up. Place remaining prosciutto slices between chicken pieces</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked through and the top is nicely browned, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top with parsley and serve immediately on olive oil mashed potatoes, rice, or pasta.</li>
    </ol>
